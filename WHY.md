## Protection

Protects against introducing new or old bugs. 

## Confidence

Can make changes or refactor and know haven't lost any features

## Documentation

Documents behaviour and flow of code so easy to understand when approaching code fresh. 

## Isolation

Isolated module from entire feature. Have to think of it that way.

## Quality. 
Enforces good, cohesive, modular design patterns in code. Bad code hard to test. Tricky to realise what is bad or too tightly coupled. Modularity means easier to share. 

Forces you to think about and use your own API.

Reduces code complexity 

## Industry Standard

Common discipline these days. “faster and more robust than coding without tests once you've got the hang of it”.
