- Modules should be isolated/extendable/reusable.
- Devs read and maintain tests. Spend a lot of time with them.
- Test behaviour, code-paths, errors, formats, boundaries. NOT implementation. <i>“cover arguments and behaviour which are tied to output (e.g. externals).”</i>
  - If arguments affect output or behaviour.
  - Behaviour = something which leads to how output is produced e.g if important to call externalModuleX (that's behaviour). Could still refactor.
  - 80/20 rule works perhaps. But if see something cover it else can cause bug later.
  - UI tests are included if have behaviour...click triggers X..or arguments change Y.
- Amount of test code should rival live code.
- Well written tests are not a formality it’s an essential part of good codebase. Semantics (clean code) play a key role in live code so the same applies to tests. 
- Good patterns help maintain consistency and styling.
  - REMEMBER you can't make incremental improvements without letting go of consistency.
- React - components return just POJOs (under the hood), so why treat any different to a normal module. No UI anymore. It's all data and data trees.
