- Spec should describe test exactly. Following sequence of logic. Branches split the specs.

- If fails spec shud tell u everything u need to know

- No side-effects testing branches

- Repeatable - same result every time.

- Readable - limit the line length per test (e.g. 10-15). 

- Coverage - aware of progress of codebase.

- Well written - maintaining a consistent format and style

- Only one thing tested per test -  so if it fails you know what's failed instantly. Concise and Isolated. 

- Fast - they are ran often.

- Without side effects

- Ignore things which will obviously work. Formatting/properties used etc are not obvious.

- Perhaps snapshot tests for obvious things
